How is our sistem different?

Our system will work in real time on a video and so it will scan the objects in a video and in real time
provide a link where the user can buy that product or a similar item. This can be used to add advertisemnet 
links to videos. Moreover our object detection system can be used to give meaningful labels to a video.

Our constraint is to be able to identify objects and provide a link to buy them in less than 1s
