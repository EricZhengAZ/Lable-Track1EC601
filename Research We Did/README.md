# Research Preparation

## Preparation on IOS
At first, we had not decided which platform to develope our application on. So we have tried to do some research on IOS. 
And then we use an example app to build our first demo. 

As shown in the use_our_model_in_IOS folder, our first demo worked well for recognize random stuffs and some natural things.

## Preparation on PC
And then, we tried to do recognition on PC because we found that develop applicaition in IOS is not that practical for us. (Three of us have Windows laptop instead of Mac laptop.) So we decided to do some research on PC before we start building a android app.

## Preparation on Android
At last we started to build our application on Android,
