#iOS app
This is an iOS app based on the example app provided by Tensorflow. The model that the orginal app used was Inception_v1. 
We trained our own model, which is a combination of Celtech 101, celtech 256 and few personalized categories. 
Here we also provided two of our trained models. They have almost the same categoirs but were trained with different steps. For example, the fold trained_20000 contains the model which was trained with 20000 steps, etc.
